            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Martyr of the People: Or, the Murder'd KING.</head>
            <p>TReason, Rebellion, Blood and Murther, are inseparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; which the loyall people of <hi>England</hi> hath groaned under these many yeers: not onely with the losse of life, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Laws, Liberties, and Estates; but of our gracious King, and Soveraign; whose memory, and sad consideration, puls up all the sluces of sorrow, and lets in a flood of tears to over-whelm the Land: our calamities like a flood is lifted up above our Earth, and hath co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the highest hils of our temporall felicitie; Could <hi>Judah</hi> mourn for the death of good King <hi>Josiah,</hi> and shall not <hi>England</hi> the losse of our vertuous King, <hi>Charls</hi> the Just; murdered by the most inhumane, cruell and barbarous people, that ever professed the title or name of Subjects in the Christian world.</p>
            <p>For a Parliament, called and summoned by their Soveraigns Writ and Authority, as the Representative of the Kingdom, for setling of the true Protestant Religion professed amongst us, for establishing the Laws and Liberties of people, and lawfull rights and Prerogatives of the King: And contrary to their faith, trust, and Allegiance, to raise Arms against him, and be the first subverters, and violators of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; Laws and Liberties; And after the tragicall Actors of murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their lawfull King before his own palace. Oh accursed act, oh blood, thirstie and perjured wretches, not to be parallel'd by Pagan or Infidell.</p>
            <p>We that were a people living in a land that flowed with milk and honey, the most happie under the Sun, happy in our Religion, Laws, and Liberties, happy in the plenty of all earthly blessings that would make us happy; happy under the government of a vertuous and pious Prince, as ever swayed the Scepter, since this Kingdom was a Monarchy: Are now become the most miserable and contemptible people in the Christian world; our losse of such a Prince as he was, is the losse of all that could make a Land or people happy in this temporall life.</p>
            <p>I shall give you a brief Character or Epitome of the personall vertues and graces of this pious Prince, which made him both glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:154064:3"/>in life and death. And first, for his Pietie and Religion, his zeale and devout frequencie in Prayer, receiving the Sacraments, his reading the Scriptures, his reverence in Gods House, his attention to Gods Word preached, the esteeme of his Messengers, his hatred of Heresie, and the zealous care he had to propagate the true Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which in the puritie thereof he established by his Lawes enlarged by his Regall Authoritie, and cleansed it from the rust of Atheisme, Faction, and Ignorance of the Times: His Royall Palace was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Receipt for pious and learned men, whom he entertained and cherished; so that that which should endeare him to his people, drew neglect, by the Schisme and irreligion of these corrupted Times, who love nothing of Christianitie but the naked name: He knew, Church-maintenance was the best Nurse of Religion; and therefore no suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, or difficulties, could so presse upon him, to alienate Gods Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Patrimonie of the Church; which to preserve from the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious invasion of the first movers of these Troubles (who thought the best way to shake off Government, was to destroy Religion, and the most effectuall and quick course to destroy Religion, was, to take away Church-maintenance) he tendred the sale of so much Crowne-Land, as would amount to the value of Church-Land.</p>
            <p>This shewed him in his life time a second <hi>David,</hi> a man after Gods owne heart, whose conversation was in Heaven. How many invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Arguments have we of his singular sanctimonie? how that in all his greatest Tryals and Afflictions, did the abundance of his joy, and the riches of his Graces and Vertues, shine forth in all his Speeches and Actions; which shewed his contemning a temporall Crowne, for an immortall and eternall one with the King of Kings.</p>
            <p>Next, for his Wisdome and Prudence, morally considered, acting in humane affaires by the ordered rules of Reason, His Majestie was nobly accomplisht: He was furnished with a good Memorie of things past, with a sound judgement, in their reference and relation to things present, and of a cleare and quick apprehension, to discerne occurrences for the future; which were both honourable and worthy in so great a Prince as he was. In summe, he was a sober, grave, and wise Prince, as appeares in all his sufferings; when he was confined; and closely imprisoned, where he could have no Counsell but what be fetcht from Heaven, that in all the transactions betwixt Him and the Parliament he appeared the wisest King in Christendome; nay,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:154064:3"/>he better understood the constitution and affaires of his Kingdomes then any man now living: This Age shewes not a man of abilitie to take up his Princely Pen, whose stile and eloquence may be the object of their wishes, but never of their imitation.</p>
            <p>Againe, whoever looks upon the sweet influence of his Justice upon all, will appeare in the peace of his Kingdome, the serenitie of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the tranquillitie of publike Affaires, the encrease of Trade, the growing riches of his Subjects, and the universall happinesse of his Government; which made these three Kingdomes thrice happy, untill the Helme of Government was wrested out of his sacred hands by these State-Empericks, usurping a Power by Blood, Murther, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of their King and fellow subjects.</p>
            <p>Looke upon his Christian fortitude and magnanimitie, with what patience he did undergoe his Afflictions, and compose his greatest pressures in the hotest flames of Adversitie, with that meeknesse and comfort, being for Gods Cause, and his peoples Rights, that he came to the Scaffold like a Lambe to the slaughter; so chearefully he layd downe his life to the violence of his cruell Adversaries.</p>
            <p>Observe likewise his Temperance, being free from all disguize in drinke, or surfeting; a matchlesse Vertue in the best of Princes.</p>
            <p>Also his Mercie and Clemencie to the bloudie and cruell rage of his Enemies, in freely forgiving them, followed his Saviours rule, prayed for his persecutors.</p>
            <p>These Divine Graces in so glorious a King, was a firme Rock against the popular rage and swelling malice of his insulting Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries (witnesse that golden Manuel, or heavenly Meditations penned by his owne Royall hand) whose pious Devotions, and Religious life, declare him to be the Temple of the holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>From the view of his Vertues, looke upon his Sufferings, and you shall finde Envie ever maliciously attending upon Vertue; and by how much the more illustrious it is, the greater hatred perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes it: you know, the troubles of the righteous are many; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold then, what sorrowes were like unto his: Consider his Sufferings from his departure from <hi>White-hall</hi> to his death, before his said Palace; and you may conclude, the Glory of <hi>England</hi> is taken from us: Remember first, how he was forced from us by tumults; his Townes, Cities, Castles, Navie, and Magazine seized upon; An
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:154064:4"/>Army raised against him, and his faithfull Subjects: into how many dangers was he exposed too, chased from place to place (not having any to hide his head with-safetie) pursued with that violence, when thousands of his loyall Subjects lost their lives, yet the Lord was his preserver in the day of trouble.</p>
            <p>I shall passe by those eminent dangers the destroying Sword threatned against his Person; And tell you of his leaving his City of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and going to the Scotch Army at <hi>Southwell,</hi> his remove to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and continuance there with them, untill he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Parliament and Army (I may say, sold) his restraint at <hi>Holmby,</hi> and after hurried away from place to place as the Army moved, and so to <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, where it was the expectation of the Kingdom to see him established in his Throne, according to their League and Covenant; But by the policy of a prevalent party in the Parliament and Army (whose tralterous acts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious practises shall brand them with infamy to all ages) he was conveyed privately to Isle of Wight, under the pretence of poysoning, whereby the people were deluded, and their hopes frustrated. In <hi>Carisbrook Castle</hi> he was confin'd to close imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; In which time of durance observe his patience in his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est tribulations, and then consider, one of the most potent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs of Europe, loved at home, feared abroad, most cruelly and strictly imprisoned, debarred from his wife, and hopefull chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, from the attendance of any of his servants, from Gods house, and publick worship, from his Chaplains, all his friends and loyal subjects; to lye under the weight of scandals, reproaches, wants, and miseries, tortured with unreasonable Propositions, and insolent Demands, tormented (if possible) unto perjury, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, and Atheisme, no conditions propounded but for sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring his Crown and Kingdoms into their hands: these were the terrible tryals of this good King in the jaws of his cruell Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who finding him like a rock, unmovable, they contended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to blood: These were they that appeared in the likenesse of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light: These were the Patriots of their Countrey that drive on their hellish designes under the shew of godlinesse: These are the Grandees of the Kingdom that would preserve His Majesties Person, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> maintain his lawfull rights, Crown, and Dignity, by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:154064:4"/>murthering him; and after make an Act for abolishing all Kingly Government in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Yet to satisfie the deluded people of <hi>England,</hi> they draw up a Charge against Him, accuse him of Murther, Treason, and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, (try Him after the form of Judicatory proceedings, without Law, or president) in the name of the Commons of <hi>England;</hi> and those Commons that thirsted after the blood of their King, are comprised in a factious and schismaticall Army; these are the men that establish iniquitie by a Law; the Jews dealt so with our Saviour, <hi>We have a Law, and by that Law he ought to dye.</hi> As he imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated his Saviour in his sufferings; so they imitated the Jews in their persecution of him. As for instance, when he was brought to his illegall tryall in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> how was he reviled, and spit upon by his barbarous and blood-thirstie Enemies; and when they cryed, Justice, Justice, and Execution: He answered not again, but with our Saviours words, <hi>God forgive them, for they know not what they say.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus from the <hi>Throne</hi> to the Block, have they brought the most pious, religious and vertuous Prince in the Christian world.</p>
            <p>They that at first engaged against him, and was the first viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their obedience due to His Majestie, you see punished: That power they gave to make him glorious, spilt his Innocent blood: Here you may see the fruits of Treason, Rebellion, and usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in varying from Christian principles, to do evill that good may come on it: The Nationall sins of <hi>England</hi> hath powr'd this calamity upon us; as the pride, hatred, and plenty of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom produced these Wars, that faction and rebellion, that the murthering of the King, the most horrid murther that ever the Sun saw: for Subjects to murther their King; and English Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, a people renowned for loyaltie, and beloved in all parts of the Universe; are now become the most contemptible people upon the face of the Earth.</p>
            <p>But you have made him a glorious King, and prov'd him glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in his personall Vertues, glorious in his divine Graces, and glorious in suffering for the cause of God, the true Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the Laws and Liberties of his three Kingdoms, and a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Saint with the King of Glory. Yet remember for all this you shall come to judgement; for blood, murther, and schisme the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:154064:5"/>Land mournes, and Gods heavie Judgements hangs over our heads: betwixt his judgements and the Kingdomes sinnes, our King is taken from us, and his death hath made the wide in-let to all our miseries; our sorrows, like a torrent, over-flowes the Land; and a generall cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is fallen upon us.</p>
            <p>Who can forget the blessed dayes we enjoyed in his Reigne? the glory and truth of Religion, the just Execution of Lawes, Peace, Riches, and Plenty, liberty at home, protection and honour abroad; <hi>England</hi> was the Garden of the World, the perfection of beauty, and the joy of the whole Earth: but now our glory is departed from our Israel, <hi>England</hi> is become a Widow, our Churches turned into Stables, and Temples become Court of Guards; the royall Palaces of our late King, made Garisons; the patrimony of the Church, the Souldiers salary; our Lawes subverted, and our Religion and Liberty destroyed, and taken from us: we are become a prey to cruell and bloody peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whose dayly practise is to destroy, and made slaves to the worst of Heathens, a people without God, without Faith, Law, Reason, and Humanity.</p>
            <p>For the losse of our King, the Land mournes: Hee that was the Comforter and protector of his people, is become the Martyr, he hath layd downe his life for his people, and exchanged this earthly and temporall Crowne, for an immortall and glorious one; where his eyes shall not see, nor his soul be afflicted with all the evill that shall fall upon us. To conclude, the remembrance of his sufferings and death shall eternize him glorious, so long as the Sun and Moone endureth; When the memory of his cruell and blood-thirsty Enemies shall perish from the face of the Earth.</p>
            <q>
               <l>We have lost the chiefest of all Earthly things:</l>
